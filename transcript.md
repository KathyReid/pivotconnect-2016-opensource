# Open source - why sharing software and hardware makes technology better for everyone

SLIDE: Title slide

## Introduction
What a great presentation by Darren!
_piece in here picking up point from Darren's presentation_

Thanks everyone, I'm Kathy Reid and I'm both the Treasurer of Creative Geelong, here in Geelong -a group dedicated to furthering the creative industries in the region, and I'm also Vice-President of Linux Australia, a group dedicated to open source in Australia - and I'll explain what that is in a minute.

I have to warn you, I am a *geek*, but don't run away screaming just yet!

## What is open source?

SLIDE: What is open source

Has anybody used freeware before? Where you can download the program and then maybe use it so many times, or it has limited features that you can unlock only if you buy the full version?

Right, so that's *not* free software - it's free as in *free beer*, but it's not free as in *freedom* or *liberty* - and that's the key difference with open source.

SLIDE: Look inside


Open source software and hardware is designed so that you can look inside the code, or the design, or the schematic. You're free to change it
