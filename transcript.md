# Open source - why sharing software and hardware makes technology better for everyone

SLIDE: Title slide

## Introduction
What a great presentation by Darren!
_piece in here picking up point from Darren's presentation_

Thanks everyone, I'm Kathy Reid and I'm both the Treasurer of Creative Geelong, here in Geelong -a group dedicated to furthering the creative industries in the region, and I'm also Vice-President of Linux Australia, a group dedicated to open source in Australia - and I'll explain what that is in a minute.

I have to warn you, I am a *geek*, but don't run away screaming just yet!

## What is open source?

SLIDE: What is open source

Has anybody used freeware before? Where you can download the program and then maybe use it only so many times, or it has limited features that you can unlock only if you buy the full version?

Right, so that's *not* free software - it's free as in *free beer*, but it's not free as in *freedom* or *liberty* - and that's the key difference with open source.

SLIDE: Look inside

Open source software and hardware is designed so that you can look inside the code, or the design, or the schematic. You're free to change it, and depending on the type of license that the work is released under, you might be obligated to pass your designs - your derivative works - back on to others to be utilised.

And so we can see again some of the principles here of the *sharing economy* that Darren was talking about.

### Examples

You might be thinking that yeah, OK that's nice, but isn't open source poorer quality than software that is proprietary or that you pay for? What mechanisms are in place to ensure quality? And that would be a fair question - the quality of open source software and hardware varies - just as much as say the quality of an AirBNB listing or an Uber ride. Mature open source projects will often have strong and robust quality assurance mechanisms in place.

In fact, some of the most prevalent software and hardware in the world is open source.
